description: How to build your chatbot's knowledge base
---

Your chatbot answers questions using a knowledge base built from your training data. The better your training data, the better the responses.

## Data sources

| Source | Best for | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Text** | FAQs, Q&A pairs, short content | [`POST /training/text`](/api-reference/training-text) |
| **URLs** | Documentation, blog posts, help articles | [`POST /training/urls`](/api-reference/training-urls) |
| **Files** | PDFs, CSVs, JSON, TXT documents | [`POST /training/files`](/api-reference/training-files) |

## Chunking strategies

When you upload content, it gets split into **chunks** — small searchable segments that the AI retrieves when answering questions.

| Strategy | Description | Best for |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `auto` | AI picks the best strategy | Most use cases (recommended) |
| `individual` | One chunk per item/row | FAQs, CSV rows, structured data |
| `semantic_groups` | Groups related content | Long documents, manuals |

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.answira.com/v1/chatbots/bot_abc/training/text \
  -H "X-API-Key: ak_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Product FAQ",
    "content": "Q: What is BGAI?\nA: An AI chatbot platform.\n\nQ: How much does it cost?\nA: Plans start at $29/month.",
    "chunking_strategy": "individual"
  }'
```

## Processing pipeline

Training is **asynchronous**. After uploading:

1. Content is queued for processing
2. Text is extracted and cleaned
3. Content is split into chunks using your chosen strategy
4. Each chunk is embedded as a vector
5. Vectors are stored in the knowledge base

Poll the [training status endpoint](/api-reference/training-status) to check progress:

```bash
curl https://api.answira.com/v1/chatbots/bot_abc/training/status \
  -H "X-API-Key: ak_live_YOUR_KEY"
```

## Tips for good training data

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Structure your FAQs clearly">
    Use `Q:` and `A:` prefixes, or CSV format with `question` and `answer` columns. The `individual` chunking strategy works best.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep content focused">
    Each training source should cover one topic. Multiple focused sources > one giant document.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include variations">
    People ask the same question in different ways. Include common phrasings in your training data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Update regularly">
    Delete outdated sources and upload fresh content. Stale data leads to wrong answers.
