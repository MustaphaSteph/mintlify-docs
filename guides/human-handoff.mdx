title: Human Handoff
description: Seamlessly transfer conversations from AI to human agents
---

When the AI can't answer a question or detects the customer needs human help, it can transfer the conversation to a live support agent.

## How it works

1. **Auto-detection** — The AI detects when it can't help (low confidence, complex query, explicit request)
2. **Routing** — The conversation is routed to the best available agent based on skills, workload, and availability
3. **Transfer** — The agent sees the full conversation history and picks up seamlessly
4. **Resolution** — The agent resolves the issue and the conversation can return to AI

## Triggering a handoff

### Automatic (AI-initiated)

When `allow_handoff` is enabled on your chatbot, the AI automatically requests a handoff when:
- Confidence is below threshold
- The customer explicitly asks for a human
- The query requires account-specific actions
- The AI detects frustration or urgency

### Manual (API-initiated)

You can also trigger a handoff programmatically:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.answira.com/v1/sessions/ses_123/handoff \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Customer needs billing adjustment"}'
```

## Checking handler status

Use the [session state endpoint](/api-reference/sessions-state) to check who's handling the conversation:

```bash
curl https://api.answira.com/v1/sessions/ses_123/state
```

```json
{
  "handler_type": "human",
  "conversation_status": "active",
  "agent_id": "agent_456",
  "agent_name": "Sarah"
}
```

## Routing strategies

Configure routing in the dashboard under **Teams → Settings**:

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Round-robin** | Distributes evenly across available agents |
| **Skill-based** | Routes to agents with matching skills |
| **Workload-based** | Routes to the agent with fewest active conversations |

## Webhook events

Subscribe to handoff events to integrate with your CRM or ticketing system:

- `handoff.triggered` — AI transferred to human
- `handoff.resolved` — Agent resolved the issue
